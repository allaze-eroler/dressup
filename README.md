# dressup
dress up game done with unity 2017.3


the goal of this project is to let people create their own dressup game since the original asset https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/character-customization-8 is no longer compatible with the lastest version of unity3D. not mention there is so many dress up games example that is now out dated or done with a different game engine... so, i decided to create one which it's open source and can be used for commercial purpose or not.

of course, it will be my first time to start coding a game like this. i will probably need your help to improve my coding skills. (and improving the game itself as well) and so, my buddy and i will be able to publish the first game.

hope you will have fun working with me :D
